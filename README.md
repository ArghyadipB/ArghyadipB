👋 Hi, I'm Arghyadip Bagchi, a data scientist with a solid foundation in software engineering, statistics, and mathematics. One thing that I truly enjoy is using data to gain insights through exploration. I am particularly passionate about applying machine learning techniques to this process, not only for uncovering patterns and trends, but also for enabling predictive decision-making. By leveraging data exploration and advanced algorithms, I aim to drive actionable outcomes and help organizations make data-driven decisions with confidence.

👀 I’m interested in NLP, Machine and Deep Learning, Transformers and LLMs.

🌱 I’m currently learning how LLMs and other generative models work deep down under the hood.
